## TODO:

- reintroduce `PTH` as an alternate source for RED
- Update docker file
- add `ignore-ops` and `ignore-red` flags (might need clearer name)
- Add ability to call with single torrent files (ie: not a dirscan)
- Add webserver to allow for calls to be sent to the container
- Add direct injection perhaps?
- Optionally read secrets from ENV vars OR Specify secrets file location
- See if I can store metadata in the torrent file to indicate the torrent was generated by this app (and therefor can be ignored)
  - Alternately, see if I can screen out torrenets that have already been generated via infohash
- Add a linter
- add build artifacts to release
